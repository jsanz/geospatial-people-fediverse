# geospatial-people-fediverse

When I joined Mastodon I couldn't a way to share the members of a list in Mastodon, so I thought it could be a good idea to just list them somewhere else so folks can find other accounts in the Fediverse (mostly on Mastodon at this moment) related with geospatial topics.

Check the accounts list as a [CSV](./accounts.csv) file.

Happy to accept new suggestions as pull requests or whatever you prefer ðŸ¤—.
