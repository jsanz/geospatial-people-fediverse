# geospatial-people-fediverse

Since I can't find a way to share the members of a list in Mastodon, I thought it could be a good idea to just list them somewhere else so folks can find other accounts in the Fediverse (mostly Mast this moment) related with geospatial topics.

Check the accounts list as a [CSV](./accounts.csv) or a [nice table](./accounts.md) 

Happy to accept new suggestions as pull requests or whatever you prefer ðŸ¤—.

Other listings:

* [fediverse.info](https://fediverse.info/explore/people), easy to enlist yourself by topics
* [fedi.directory](https://fedi.directory/) maintained manually by [@fedifollos](https://mastodon.online/@fedifollows)
* [mapstodon.space](https://mapstodon.space/explore) is a full Mastodon instance dedicated to geospatial people
